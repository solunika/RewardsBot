# Descripci√≥n 

An experimental bot (initially for discord) that allows us to manage a reward system through coins and items that can be purchased

It allows:
- Manage balances in wallets
- Transfer balances between members' wallets
- Manage items to the server store catalog
- Spend the coins on these items
# Implementation


A discord bot manages **tokens** or **coins**, these coins can be spent in the **store** o transfered among chat server's members.
